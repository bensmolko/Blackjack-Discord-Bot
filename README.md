# Blackjack-Discord-Bot

This is a discord bot that plays blackjack with you. Once properly connected to a discord bot account, you can use the command '.bet' followed by number to bet a certain amount of points depending on how much you have in your account. This program uses an sqlite database to track the amount of points earned by each wager. You can also use the command '.points' to see how many points you currently have. Everyone starts out with zero points, so if you type '.bet 0' and happen to win, you will earn 10 free points without wagering any. As is, the bot will not run until you register your own discord security key, as I must keep the bot's actual key private.

Enjoy!
